<p>This is a leadership development workshop with a difference.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Many people understand the concept of leadership and team working from a conceptual level. Our participants are always bright people and intellectually they understand the principles of leadership and building a successful team.</p>
<p>There is of course a huge difference between those who can quote the research and thosewho can really take charge and inspire a group of people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This workshop has been designed to lift the concepts of leadership off the page and to allow participants to experience leadership and teamwork in a constructive and powerful environment.</p>
<p>The workshop is based around some core principles and we challenge participants to put leadership into practice and to receive feedback on their</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>performance. We ask participants to embark on a series of projects and challenges designed to bring the best out of teams and individuals.</p>
<h2>Style:</h2>

<li>Have improved their ability to manage complex tasks and to communicate and engage people on the journey</li>
<li>Be clearer on their personal leadership values and how these impact performance</li>
<li>Be committed and clear on the personal changes needed to strengthen the role as both leader and colleague back at work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aims:</h2>
<p>This workshop uses experiential learning. Most of the time will be spent working as part of a team and taking on a variety of projects and challenges designed to hone each participant’s leadership style and to stretch their skills and contribution as a team member.</p>
<p>We use outdoor development for part of the workshop. This helps build a a more authentic leadership experience.</p>
<p>The workshop is designed to put leaders into a situation where effective leadership and teamwork are the main catalysts that forge successful outcomes. They will work closely with a facilitator and their colleagues on the workshop to extract key learning points.</p>
<p>The programme also contains a number of central sessions that explore the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values and authentic leadership</li>
<li>Focussing yourself and your team on results</li>
<li>Team dynamics in action and how to manage these</li>
<li>Personality and the impact on style and performance</li>
<li>Collaboration v competition</li>
<li>The power of constructive feedback to build confidence and performance</li>
