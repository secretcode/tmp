	<strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); font-size: 18px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">10 TIPS OF WRITING RESUME.</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">
	<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The thought of writing a resume intimidates almost anyone. It's difficult to know where to start or what to include. It can seem like an insurmountable task. Here are 10 tips to help you not only tackle the task, but also write a winning resume.</span></div>
<ol>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Determine your job search objective prior to writing the resume. Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objective as the bull's-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Think of your resume as a marketing tool. Think of yourself as a product, potential employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job. You don't need to go into detail about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Use bulleted sentences. In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Use action words. Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Use Numbers, Rs, and percentages stand out in the body of a resume. Here are two examples: · Managed a department of 10 with a budget of Rs.1, 000,000. · Increased sales by 30% in a territory.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Lead with your strengths. Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective. Put those strong points first where they are more apt to be read.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Accent the positive. Leave off negatives and irrelevant points. If you feel your date of graduation will subject you to age discrimination, leave the date off your resume. If you do some duties in your current job that don't support your job search objective, leave them off your resume. Focus on the duties that do support your objective. Leave off irrelevant personal information like your height and weight.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Show what you know. Rather than going into depth in one area, use your resume to highlight your breadth of knowledge. Use an interview to provide more detail.</span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 80px;">
		<span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Show who you know. If you have reported to someone important such as a vice president or department manager, say so in your resume. Having reported to someone important causes the reader to infer that you are important.&nbsp;</span></li>
